# Sunshine
The first course under the Android Developer Nanodegree Program on Udacity is called </br> "Developing Android Apps : Android Fundamentals" where we develop a weather forecast application called Sunshine. This is the code base for the app I developed through this course. </br>
Here is the link to the course: www.udacity.com/course/developing-android-apps--ud853 </br>
To install Sunshine on your device, you may find the apk file in the 'app' directory of this repository.
